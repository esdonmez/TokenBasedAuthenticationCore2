# ASPNETcoreAngularJWT

Here is very basic show case for jwt bearer token authorization, using angular as front end and ASP.NET Core as backend.
ASP.NET Core2 angular 4 with systemjs.

***********************************************************

(Why systemjs not webpack? Personal opinion: webpack just too complicated to use for any small size, simple application, I rather scarified efficient to let most programmers can read my example code)

**************************************************************************


Now you can stop google and find out how to do bear JWT token Authentication, it is simple!
 
At backend: MS$ provide middleware AddAuthentication().AddJwtBearer() for bear JWT token Authentication, so, things turns to be as simple as add the middleware at Startup.cs 

At frontend(angular in this case): save the token in sessionStorage, and when talking to backend, set header of http(https for production) request as:

     let headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
     headers.append("Authorization", "Bearer " + token);

************************************************************
Angular (4.3.5) in ASP.NET Core 2 (VS2017 or csproj version)with JWT solution.

Make sure:

ASP.NET CORE 2 has been installed, if not, get from here:
  https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core
  
nodejs has been installed, if not, get from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

after download this repositiry, go to folder with file ASPNETCoreAngularJWT.csproj and run command:

    >dotnet restore
   
    >npm install
   
    >npm start
   
Finally start dotnet and browser http://localhost:5000 by

    >dotnet run
   
And do not forget to run "npm start" after modify any typescript files.

You can run this for angular compile and dotnet run

    >npm run runall

Also it can be opened by both Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code.
After open by VS2017 and before run as debug, make sure project-> property -> Debug and App URL ="http://localhost:5000" and rebuild again before start to debug
